# Visual essay tags

Essay visualizations are created (and optionally controlled) by a couple of special HTML tags that are added to the essay markdown text.  Two HTML tags are currently used.

- The __param__ tag is used to define visualizations that are associated with an essay section or paragraph.  The `param` tags all start on a new line and include attributes defining the specific visualization to create and all required options.
- The __span__ tag is used to wrap sections of text in the essay to associate the text with an entity or to use the text as a interaction trigger.  An example of an interaction trigger would be connecting a location reference in the essay text to an interaction that causes the map to "fly to" a specific location when the user clicks on or hovers over the "spanned" text in the essay.

HTML tags begin with the `<` character and end with the `>` character.  The text after the `<` character and before the first space define the tag name.  The HTML language defines many tags but the visual essay tool only uses the `param` and `span` tags.  Both of these are standard HTML tags that have been extended for use by the visual essay tool.  In the case of the `param` tag a visual essay type attribute and optional options attributes are used to define the type of visualization generated.  The visual essay type attribute starts with `ve-` and defines the specific component used to render the visualizaiton.  Below are a few commonly used `ve` type attributes.
```html
- ve-image
- ve-map
- ve-video
```

More detailed information on these tags and others are provided in the following sections.

## Configuration and data tags

The two tags in this section, the `ve-config` and `ve-entity` tags, do not directly correspond to a specific visualization but rather are used to provide general data that guides the overall rendering of the essay.  The `ve-config` tag is used to define overall formatting and essay-level metadata such as title and author name(s).  The `ve-entity` tag is used to identify entities (people, locations, organizations, taxon elements, etc) that are referenced in or otherwise applicable to the essay text.  Data associated with entities identified by a ve-entity tag is retrieved from an external knowledge graph.

- [Entity declaration](ve-entity)

## Visualization component tags

The tags in this section are used to declare and configure one or multiple visualizers that are associated with an essay section or paragraph.
