### The Popularity of Peonies

<span eid="Q147105">Peonies</span> were first cultivated for their attractiveness and fragrance more than 1400 years ago in China and became especially popular under the <span eid="Q9683">Tang Dynasty.</span> In the Tang imperial gardens, tree (or moutan) peonies reigned as the “king of flowers” and were believed to symbolize happiness, wealth, and prosperity. We can see the association of peonies with wealth and class in a rare scroll painting from the Tang dynasty, which depicts five ladies of the Tang court and one maidservant. The rank and prestige of each <span data-click-image-zoomto="3599,-267,2284,1914">lady</span> is shown by their scale relative to one another as well as the lavish <span data-click-image-zoomto="2737,1,617,535">peonies</span> that adorn their hair. As the popularity of peonies grew, so too did their varieties. Peony plants were selected, hybridized, bred, and eventually grafted for their fragrance, petal color, petal number, and size.[^1]

The center of imperial peony cultivation was in <span eid="Q187136">Luoyang</span> where there were peony festivals and competitions, gardens devoted solely to peonies, and even a peony research center. This led to a plethora of ornamental peony cultivars as peony breeding became an artform. More than 200 peony cultivars were described during the <span eid="Q7462">Song Dynasty,</span> and today, China alone has more than 1,000 cultivars.

While there were species of herbaceous peony native to Europe, ornamental peony cultivars, which had already benefitted from centuries of cultivation, grafting, and hybridization in Chinese and Islamic gardens, were introduced through the floriculture of the <span eid="Q12560">Ottoman Empire</span> in the sixteenth century.[^2] It was not until the eighteenth century, however, that Europeans would begin intensively breeding ornamental peonies. 
<param ve-image manifest="https://ids.si.edu/ids/manifest/FS-7258_37">

In 1789, famed British naturalist <span eid="Q153408">Sir Joseph Banks</span> acquired a “moutan peony tree” <span eid="Q163076">(_Paeonia lactiflora_)</span> from Canton, China through his connections with the <span eid="Q83164">British East India Company.</span> The tree survived the arduous journey to Britain, where it was planted in the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew. Other peonies from China soon followed, ushering in something of a peony craze in Europe. Peonies became increasingly popular as French, English, and American horticulturists began developing ornamental varieties of their own.[^3]

As a Chinese botanical export and a prominent flower in Ottoman gardens, peonies carried connotations of the “exotic Orient” and quickly became a popular subject in nineteenth century art. The depiction of peonies in nineteenth-century French art, however, does more than simply signify the exotic or differentiate <span eid="Q160381">Occident</span> and <span eid="Q205653">Orient.</span>[^4] For example, in <span edit="Q207298">Frédéric Bazille’s</span> _Black Woman with Peonies,_ the foreign provenance of ornamental peonies is emphasized by the Black model, who arranges the blooms in an <span data-click-image-zoomto="22,583,979,821">“Oriental” vase.</span> Interestingly, however, Bazille pairs the peonies with <span data-click-image-zoomto="138,0,979,821">irises,</span> France’s national flower. Once new and exotic, but now also bred in France, ornamental peony cultivars had become a product of cultural hybridity, simultaneously signaling the plant’s eastern origin as well as the new varieties that were being developed in France.[^5]

Henderson's botanical illustration highlights a trait of sunflowers that we may overlook due to our casual familiarity with the plant. Its flower heads are not single blossoms. _Helianthus_, like other members of the aster family, Asteraceae, produces a special kind of inflorescence: a composite of many tiny flowers known as florets.[^ref27] This diagram of a mature flower head shows that what we generally call “petals” are actually ray florets; they are sterile and serve to attract pollinators to disk florets. The disk florets, which can number in the hundreds or thousands, grow in a spiral pattern and each one can develop its own fruit after pollination. Perceiving such floral traits and examining their functions require a process of direct observation and visual analysis that is practiced by scientists and artists alike.

In the late afternoon of a hot summer day in June 2019, an extraordinary and rare flower began to bloom at the <span eid="Q636275">New York Botanical Garden (NYBG)</span>. A press release was immediately sent out as visitors had only 24 to 36 hours to the see the world’s largest inflorescence (flower-bearing structure) in peak bloom. It was not just the size of the <span eid="Q431224">_Amorphophallus titanum_</span>, however, that would attract hundreds of thousands of visitors. It was also the fact that, as its common name “corpse flower” suggests, this gigantic plant, when in bloom, smells like rotting flesh.

Today, peonies remain one of the most sought-after ornamental flowers in the world. Thanks to their abundant delicate petals, peonies often adorn gardens and homes, and are popular for wedding bouquets and floral arrangements. As we can see, peonies have long been, and continue to be, a coveted ornamental plant, but what may surprise you is that they also have an equally long history as a powerful medicinal therapeutic.

### The Secret Ingredient

In 1735, a Viennese baroness wrote to the last Medici princess, <span id="Q233181">Anna Maria Luisa de Medici (1669-1743)</span>,  to thank her for sending a miraculous infant convulsion powder. Anna Maria Luisa’s recipe for infant convulsion powder contained a precipitation of a human skull of a man (who died violently but was never buried), a precipitation of “Oriental pearls,” a precipitation of red coral and white coral, as well as yellow amber and peony roots and seeds. While the more outrageous ingredients such as pulverized human skull and Oriental pearls stand out, it was actually the use of <span data-click-image-zoomto="901,1073,847,637">peony</span> that made Anna Maria Luisa’s powder effective.

In her letter to Anna Maria Luisa, the Vieannese baroness praised the powder’s effectiveness and stated that the children she treated with it had been so violently taken by convulsions that the physicians had “given up on them.” Not only had the “miraculous powder” cured the children, the baroness also stated that a number of months had passed, and the children remained in perfect health. Anna Maria Luisa was well known for her miraculous powder, which she distributed strategically to influential individuals and courts across Europe. Through the strategic distribution of her infant convulsion powder, Anna Maria Luisa created valuable socio-political alliances to protect <span eid="Q154849">The Grand Duchy of Tuscany</span> as the end of the Medici dynasty neared.

### Shaoyao: The Medicine Made from Peony

Although today we think of peonies as beautiful ornamental flowers, they have been used as medicinal plants for more than a millennium. Peony is the single genus in the _Paeoniaceae_ family, which has about 30 species found in western North America, Northwest Africa, and temperate Eurasia. China, with 15 species, 10 of which are endemic, is the center of the family’s bio-geographic distribution.

<param ve-map-layer geojson active url="peony.json" title="Peony Distribution"> 

Two species of _Paeonia_ were particularly important in ancient Chinese medical practice, <span id="Q163076">_Paeonia lactiflora_</span>, which was the primary source of both white peony and red peony, and <span id="Q163018">_Paeonia suffruticosa_</span>, commonly known as the tree peony or “moutan”. The earliest record of the use of peony in Chinese medicine was discovered in an imperial Chinese Han tomb (AD 25–220). Writings within the tomb confirmed that peony root (called “danpi”), likely _P._ _suffruticosa_, was used to treat blood stasis nearly 2,000 years ago.[^6]

<param ve-plant-specimen jpid="10.5555/al.ap.specimen.k000687216">

More than a millennium later in 1644, and a testament to peony’s long history as an important medicinal simple, a high <span id="Q9903">Ming</span> illustrated <span id="Q6165948">herbal</span>, _Bencao tupu_ 本草圖譜, beautifully depicted _P. lactiflora_, also known as common Chinese garden peony. _P. lactiflora_ is the source of both red and white Chinese garden peony and both were (and remain) important medicinal herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the herbal, _P. lactiflora_ was used to treat gynecological symptoms including hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles. It was also used in the treatment of high blood pressure and inflammation.[^7] The compound Chinese characters for white peony, “Shaoyao,” and the varient for red peony, "Hongyao," (written in the top right corner of the illustration) reveal the plant’s importance in medicine. The first character of both, “shao” and "hong," refer to the peony plant, while the second character “yao” means medicine. Thus, both mean “the medicine made from peony.”[^8]

### Peony in Western Medicine

Outside of China, peony had an equally long history of medicinal use in Europe. In his herbal, <span id="Q3704131">_de Materia Medica_</span>, the Greek physician <span id="Q297776">Dioscorides</span> identified two types of peonies used in medicine: the male and female peony. Today these are identified as <span id="Q161482">_Paeonia mascula_</span> and <span id="Q159738">_Paeonia officinalis_</span> respectively. According to <span id="Q457191">Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s</span> 16th century commentary on _de Materia Medica_, Dioscorides prescribed giving the dry root of _P. officinalis_ to women to provoke menstruation (an <span id="Q2602077">emmenagogue</span>) and to treat kidney and bladder discomfort among several other gynecological ailments. The Roman naturalist, <span id="Q82778">Pliny the Elder</span>, also recommended _P. officinalis_ for “female diseases,” stating, “[One great remedy for all female diseases in common, is the black seed of the herbaceous plant pæonia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:26.90).”  
<param ve-image title="Mattioli, i discorsi, pg. 964" url="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pageImage/51722142">

In addition to the “cleansing” and purgative properties associated with peony and women’s health, the Roman physician <span eid="Q8778">Galen</span> recommended tying peony root <span data-click-image-zoomto="248,1,646,492">around the necks</span> of children as an effective remedy for “the falling sickness,” which was a common pre-modern phrase for <span id="Q41571">epilepsy</span>.[^9] Throughout the middle ages, peony continued to be used as a medicinal simple for the treatment of epilepsy or convulsions. For example, the female medieval healer and Benedictine abbess, <span id="Q70991">Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179)</span> instructed “When one falls with epilepsy, place in his mouth [peony] while he lies there, and do this every time he falls with this disease, and he will be finally cured.”[^10] In addition to treating epilepsy, fits, and convulsions, peony was also used as <span data-click-image-zoomto="0,1,936,862">a cure for lunacy and sciatica</span>. 
<param ve-image region="117,225,374,299" title="Curing lunacy with spring of peony and sciatica with peony root, Medical illustrations in medieval manuscripts by Loren MacKinney, Wellcome Library" url="https://digital.onb.ac.at/rep/access/iiif/image/v2/5af078d29f16830e265eff7ab2beb33959557f6bc7607878276736a371c0dc527785d8dab0f055dbe9e7baef178eb98222c3bd5c3f1c/info.json">

<span eid="Q6165948">European printed herbals</span> of the sixteenth century continued to prescribe peony for seizures and epilepsy. While many of these herbals still referenced Galen’s recommendation to tie the root around the necks of children, they also prescribed more powerful peony therapeutics in the form of distilled waters, powders, syrups, and compound medicines to be taken internally. For example, <span eid="Q205031">Castore Durante’s</span> popular Italian herbal printed in 1585 described how distilled water of female peony root and flowers relieved children who suffered from “mal caduco” (epilepsy or seizures). He also noted that it benefited apoplectics and paralytics as well. Similarly, in his 1597 herbal, English naturalist <span id="Q1333338">John Gerard</span> noted that a syrup made from peony “helpeth greatly the falling sickness, likewise the extraction of on the rootes doth the same.”

### Nature's Pharmaceuticals
As we can see, for more than two thousand years numerous peony species were used as a powerful herbal therapeutic across societies in Europe and Asia. <span eid="Q861699">Herbal medicine</span> in the western tradition, however, changed dramatically over the course of the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as European chemists, botanists, and physicians began favoring the creation of <span eid="Q46857">standardized and systematic medical experimentation</span> to assess the efficacy of plant medicines and identify and isolate their active chemical compounds. This led to an emphasis on the individual organic compounds within plants and the organic chemical synthesis of these compounds to produce more effective drugs. It also marked the birth of modern pharmaceuticals, many of which are derived or synthetic analogues of naturally occurring chemical structures. The ability to isolate, purify, and synthesize chemical structures created <span eid="Q507443">highly efficacious and powerful drugs</span>. Thus, despite being the antecedent of modern chemical pharmaceuticals, herbal simples and compound herbal medicines were slowly replaced and increasingly viewed as outdated, crude, ineffectual, and, in some cases, even dangerous.

While modern western medicine tends to dismiss pre-modern therapeutics like Anna Maria Luisa’s infant convulsion powder, numerous scientific studies on several species of peony used medically in East Asia have revealed isolated compounds that possess antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic properties.[^11] Peony roots and flowers continue to be used as a medicinal simple in <span eid="Q200253">Traditional Chinese</span> and <span eid="Q132325">Ayurvedic</span> medicine. While fewer studies have been conducted on European species of peony used medicinally, there have been several studies conducted to test for the bioactive compounds responsible for _P. officinalis’s_ effect on seizures.
<param ve-image fit="contain" title="Theory of diseases treated with decoction of Radix Puerariae, Wellcome Collection." url="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0038032.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg">

A study conducted in 1991 on the water extract of _P. officinalis_ concluded that there are several chemical compounds found in the root, including <span id="Q7124104">paeoniflorin</span>, albiflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, and gallotannins that have documented anticonvulsant properties.[^12] Furthermore, when isolated, the compounds albiflorin and gallotannin were proven to block extracellular calcium, which is linked to intracellular seizure-related phenomena. Paeoniflorin fractions also showed inhibition, but to a weaker extent. An additional study, which administered peony root extract (from _P. officinalis_) to rats, concluded that it was “a potent in vitro inhibitor of neuron damage in the CA1 area of the hippocampus.”[^13] The study also determined that peony root extract had protective effects on damaged neurons as well as anticonvulsant action when administered orally.[^14] Finally, the administration of antiepileptic drugs early has the potential to [alter the long-term course of epilepsy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29726099), with the possibility of preventing it from becoming an “intractable disorder.”
<param ve-image url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/main/Peony/Peony_compounds.jpg">

Today, the primary approach to treating epilepsy and suppressing seizures is to alter the neural network’s excitability or inhibition by regulating chemical compounds such as sodium and calcium. Drugs like <span id="Q421567">ethosuximide</span> reduce abnormal electrical activity in the brain by regulating calcium influx in cells. Thus, in contemporary western medicine there is little market demand to further investigate the peony root’s similar biochemical compounds or potential pharmaceutical applications. This lack of contemporary interest, however, does not make the biochemical activity of peony insignificant historically. The identification of active biochemical compounds suggest that Anna Maria Luisa’s powder might have actually improved the health of the children who received it!

The probable effectiveness of her infant convulsion powder increased Anna Maria Luisa’s socio-political influence. In fact, several letters preserved in the Florence State Archive attest to the powder’s efficacy and popularity. In one such letter, the previously mentioned Viennese baroness wrote again to Anna Maria Luisa requesting additional portions of powder given the “extraordinary effects they had on three children from the most important families of Vienna.” Anna Maria Luisa replied that she would send the baroness as much of the powder as she desired to distribute to her friends, considering that she had “put the powder to such good use.”

The gift of “miraculous” medicine to the Viennese court was not simply altruistic. As a woman, Anna Maria Luisa was barred from inheriting and ruling Tuscany on the death of <span data-click-image-zoomto="524,236,1525,1146">her brother</span>, the <span eid="Q256580">last Medici Grand Duke</span>. Although she lacked official power, Anna Maria Luisa fashioned influence through the gift of her infant convulsion powder, which allowed her to ingratiate herself with some of <span data-click-image-zoomto="214,581,1271,955">Vienna’s most important and powerful families</span>. This ensured goodwill and communication between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the court that would decide its fate. By the end of the Medici dynasty, the Viennese court was the headquarters of the <span eid="Q645719">Habsburg dynasty</span> and the center of its imperial politics. In 1737, <span eid="Q151075">Francis of Lorraine</span>, future head of the <span eid="Q12548">Holy Roman Empire</span> which controlled much of Europe at this time, became the Grand Duke of Tuscany and ruled Florence from the imperial court in Vienna—a court much indebted to Anna Maria Luisa’s infant convulsion powder and the power of peony.
