![](/images/digital-skills.png)

Because it uses free and open technologies like [Wikidata](https://www/wikidata.org), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [IIIF](https://iiif.io), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [D3](https://d3js.org/), [Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) and more, Juncture is a great way to level-up your digital skills.  All you need is a [Github](https://github.com) account and a willingness to learn.

# What do you need to start using Juncture?
<param id="prerequisites" class="cards">

##

**An interest in visual storytelling** - Juncture makes it easy to build interactive essays that augment text with rich and engaging visualizations.

##

**10 minutes to create your first Visual Essay** - See for yourself how quick and easy it is to create and share an interactive Visual Essay.

##

**A (free) Github account** - Visuals Essays are stored on the Github site.  If you're not familiar with Github think of it as a file hosting service (like Dropbox or Google Drive).  It's much more that that but for our purposes it's primarily a place to store files on the web.  For a more detailed discussion of what Github is and how Juncture uses it please refer to this [page](https://github.com/jstor-labs/juncture/wiki/Github-overview).

Each Visual Essay has a default stable URL that can be used for viewing and sharing the essay.  Others URLs (including using your own custom domain) for an essay can be used when an optional Juncture site is created.

The [Viewing and Sharing Visual Essays](https://github.com/jstor-labs/juncture/wiki/Viewing-and-Sharing-Visual-Essays) guide provides simple instructions for accessing and sharing your Visual Essays.

## Create a Juncture site

![](/images/public-site.png)

Some users may want to go beyond simply creating and sharing Visual Essays.  Juncture can be used to create a full-featured website that includes multiple Visual Essays and other content pages.  

The [Juncture Site Quick Start](https://github.com/jstor-labs/juncture/wiki/Juncture-Site-Quick-Start) guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring a new Juncture site.  Instructions are also provided for adding and modifying content.

## Create a public site

Your Juncture site will run out of Github, where it is easy to connect it to a registered domain name, making it easier to share with the world.

## Keep your site just for you, your friends or your class

Since it runs out of Github, your Juncture site can be kept private, used for your own purposes or as part of a project-based learning exercise.
