Juncture is a free-to-use, open source framework for converting simple text files into an engaging visual essay. A visual essay is an interactive and responsive web page that augments a text narrative with visual elements to provide depth and context.

With Juncture you can create a single essay or build a full website consisting of multiple visual essays with navigation, site info pages, contact form, logo, and other simple customizations.

Your Juncture site will run out of Github, where it is easy to connect it to a registered domain name, making it easier to share with the world.

## Keep your site just for you, your friends or your class
